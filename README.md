#### **Project Overview**
The Bank Service Application is a robust and scalable banking platform designed to facilitate user management, card services, and transaction processing. Built with a focus on modularity and simplicity, this project employs modern technologies to address real-world banking needs.

---

#### **Purpose**
The primary aim of this application is to provide a backend foundation for:
- Managing user profiles and accounts.
- Handling card-related operations such as creation, retrieval, and deletion.
- Processing financial transactions while ensuring security and accuracy.

This project aims to simplify banking workflows, offering seamless integration with front-end systems and potential third-party services.

---

#### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot (Java)
  - **Modules**: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot DevTools.
- **Database**: H2 Database (File-based persistence for easy development and testing).
- **Frontend Integration**: Thymeleaf for rendering HTML templates.
- **Build and Dependency Management**: Maven.
- **Development Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, JUnit for testing.
- **Other Libraries**:
  - Hibernate for ORM.
  - SLF4J for logging.

---

#### **Future Ambitions**
- **Integrating Cloud Services**:
  - Transitioning from H2 to cloud-based databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
  - Implementing AWS or Google Cloud for hosting.
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Adding encryption for sensitive data (e.g., passwords).
  - Integrating OAuth2 or JWT for secure authentication.
- **Microservices Architecture**:
  - Decoupling components for independent scalability.
  - Enabling API-based communication with external services.
- **Mobile Support**:
  - Introducing REST APIs for mobile banking applications.

   - **Service Layer**: [BankService.java](https://github.com/Prince07746/Bank-Service/blob/main/src/main/java/Bank/service/BankService.java) contains business logic.
   - **Repositories**: Data is accessed via [CardRepository.java](https://github.com/Prince07746/Bank-Service/blob/main/src/main/java/Bank/repository/CardRepository.java), [TransactionRepository.java](https://github.com/Prince07746/Bank-Service/blob/main/src/main/java/Bank/repository/TransactionRepository.java), and [UserClientRepository.java](https://github.com/Prince07746/Bank-Service/blob/main/src/main/java/Bank/repository/UserClientRepository.java).
   - **Database**: H2-based persistence with schema management.

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - HTML templates (`index.html`, `about.html`) located in the `templates` directory.
